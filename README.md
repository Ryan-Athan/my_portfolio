# Portfolio Website

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, where I showcase who I am, my skills, and the work I have accomplished over the years. Itâ€™s not just a static website but a reflection of my passion for development and creativity.

I created this portfolio to highlight my journey as a developer. Itâ€™s designed to be lightweight and modern, focusing on a clean and professional layout. The website adapts seamlessly to any device, offering a great user experience whether you're on a desktop or mobile device. I wanted this portfolio to stand out by including multi-language support and customizable themes for both dark and light mode enthusiasts.

This project also serves as a practical demonstration of my technical expertise, as itâ€™s built entirely with React and optimized using Vite for fast loading times.
